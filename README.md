  * Cecchetti & Schoenholtz's Money, Banking, and Financial Markets stays relevant and interesting through the text's unique emphasis on the Five Core Principles, the early introduction of risk, an integrated global perspective, and the integration of FRED data in the text and problem material. By focusing on the big picture via core principles, Cecchetti & Schoenholtz teaches students the rationale for financial rules and institutional structure so that even when the financial system evolves, students' knowledge will not be out of date.
